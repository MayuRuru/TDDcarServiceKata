## TDD practice

Build a Car Renting Service

**Requirements** 
* Create a service that once it receives a user id and a car id, it creates, saves and returns a new rental item.
* The user must have: id and name.
* The car must have: id, number plate and brand.
* The rental item must contain: id, user, car and rental date.
* The rental can only be made if the car in question is not rented.

**Constraints**
* Do the practice with TDD 
* Remember that it is a unit test of the service so you cannot raise databases or Api Controllers.
* Solve with dependency injection the extra classes you need (Do not use Autowire)
* Use good practices such as naming (in English).
